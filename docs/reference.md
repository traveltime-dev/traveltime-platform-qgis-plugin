# Reference manual ![](images/icons/general.svg#header)

This reference manual covers all features of the TravelTime platform plugin for QGIS.

For an introduction about how to use it, you may prefer to have a look at the tutorials first.

To learn more about TravelTime platform and to discuss commercial licences visit [our website](http://traveltimeplatform.com).

## Installation

### Requirements

This plugin works on QGIS version 3.0 or higher.

### Install

The plugin can be installed using the QGIS plugin manager.

Choose `Manage and install plugins` from the `Plugin menu`.

![](images/reference/install.png)

In the plugin manager window, make sure you are on the `All` tab, and search for `TravelTime`. The plugin will appear in the list. Select it in the list, and click on `install`.

### Upgrade and uninstall

If an update is available, you will get notified from the main QGIS window. The plugin can be upgraded or uninstalled from the plugin manager window.

## User interface

### Splash screen

![](images/reference/splashscreen.png)

After installation and on QGIS start, the plugin will show a splash screen. You can prevent it from showing again by checking the `don't show again` checkbox.

### Toolbar

![](images/reference/toolbar.png)

### Move, show or hide

By default, the toolbar appears at the top of the window. You can drag and drop it to move it elsewhere, or completely toggle its visibility by right-clicking on an empty space of the user interface and by (un)checking "TravelTime platform toolbar".

### Content

![](images/icons/settings.svg#icon) Open the [settings dialog](#settings-dialog)

### Menu

![](images/reference/menu.png)

The same actions are also available from the `plugin menu`.

## API limit

At some point, you **will** hit the API limit, which will cause some queries to fail.

![](images/reference/limit_exceeded_express.png)  
_An API limit error when running a map tool_

![](images/reference/limit_exceeded_processing.png)  
_An API limit error when running an algorithm_

Each API key has a quota of queries that can be done. Currently, for free keys, this is around 10 searches / minute. Once this quota is reached, all subsequent queries fail for the cooldown period.

All successful queries are saved in a cache file on your computer. This means that after the cooldown period, you can rerun your algorithm, and it will only make calls to the API for the new queries, so that you can finish running your algorithm event if it failed before.

## Tools

### ![](images/icons/rerun.svg#icon) Rerun algorithm

Re-opens the algorithm dialog with the same settings. To use this tool, you need to select a layer that was created from one of the algorithms in the legend.

This feature is very useful to tweak your queries without having to reset all parameters manually.

### ![](images/icons/timemap_express.svg#icon) Quick Time Map

This runs the _quick time map_ tool. In the background, the advanced time map algorithm will be run. This algorithm returns a **polygon** layer representing the area that can be reached from one point, or the area from which a point can be reached.

Usage : click the action, then click somewhere on the map canvas to create a time map. A new layer will be added to the project with the time time. That layer is a "temporary layer". If you need to save it, right click on it in the legend, and choose `Make permanent`.

Configuration : click on the small arrow, then configure using the following widget. The time parameter uses your system local time, so you need to manually convert the time if you are working in different time zone.

![](images/reference/express_timemap_config.png)

### ![](images/icons/timefilter_express.svg#icon) Quick Time Filter

This runs the _quick time filter_ tool. In the background, the advanced time filter algorithm will be run. This algorithm allows to filter a **point** layer according to a time map search.

Usage : first, select a **point** layer in the legend, then click the action, then click somewhere on the map canvas to create a time map. A new layer will be added to the project with the reachable and unreachable points. That layer is a "temporary layer". If you need to save it, right click on it in the legend, and choose `Make permanent`.

Configuration : click on the small arrow, then configure using the following widget. The time parameter uses your system local time, so you need to manually convert the time if you are working in different time zone.

![](images/reference/express_timefilter_config.png)

### ![](images/icons/route_express.svg#icon) Quick Route

This runs the _quick route_ tool. In the background, the advanced route algorithm will be run. This algorithm allows to compute the best route between points.

Usage : click the action, then click somewhere on the map canvas to define the starting point, and click again to define the destination point. A new layer will be added to the project containing the route. That layer is a "temporary layer". If you need to save it, right click on it in the legend, and choose `Make permanent`.

Configuration : click on the small arrow, then configure using the following widget. The time parameter uses your system local time, so you need to manually convert the time if you are working in different time zone.

![](images/reference/express_route_config.png)

### ![](images/icons/geoclick.svg#icon) Geoclick

This runs the _geoclick_ tool.

Usage : with any map tool enabled, enter an address in the input field next to the button, then click on the button. This will simulate a mouse click on the map at the address that you entered. It can be used with any map tool, including the quick tools.

In the background, the geocoding algorithm will be run.

![](images/reference/geoclick.png)

## Settings dialog

The main settings dialog can be open using the ![](images/icons/settings.svg#icon) icon.

![](images/reference/config.png)

**App ID** and **API Key** : enter your App ID and API Key here. You need to do this step to be able to use the TravelTime web service. You can get the ID and the Key by email by clicking on the **Get a free API key** button and filling out the web form.

**Clear cache** : this button allows to clear the request cache. All requests are saved to a cache file, to avoid the need of hitting the API if an identical request was already made. By clearing the cache, all saved queries will be deleted. This shouldn't be necessary unless you have a very high usage of the application and the cache file gets too big.

**Throttle API calls** : when enabled, the plugin will check how many calls were made to the API during the last minute. If above the provided threshold, the plugin will wait before sending the next query to avoid hitting the limit. Use this option if you prefer to avoid API limit errors from interrupting your workflows. Note that throttling can be disabled by the advanced algorithms paramters.

**Log API calls to the message logs** : this settings makes the plugin log all requests and responses to the QGIS Message Log, allowing to inspect what's happening in case you encounter errors.

**Disable HTTPS certificate verification** : under certain circumstances (such as connection from an enterprise network), requests made from Python may fail because the SSL certificates can not be verified. If this happens, you can disable the verification by checking this box. Please be aware that this makes your requests to the API more vulnerable to interception by an attacker.

**Customize endpoint** : if you are not using the default TravelTime Platform API endpoint, you can customize it here.

## Help dialog

The online help dialog can be open using the ![](images/icons/help.svg#icon) icon.

![](images/reference/help.png)

This dialog shows the online help directly in QGIS.

**Return to help index** : returns to the home page of the online help in case you got lost.

**Open in browser** : opens your browser at the same page, which may be more comfortable to browse the documentation.

## Background tiles

The background tiles icon ![](images/icons/tiles.svg#icon) opens up the browser at the XYZ tiles section. To use a background layer, double click it in the list or drag it into the map canvas.

Depending on your API key capabilities, it will automatically add additional XYZ layers that you can use as background.

![](images/reference/tiles_without.png) ![](images/reference/tiles_with.png)

If your API key doesn't provide this capability, you will get a message providing instructions on how to get access to those tiles.

![](images/reference/tiles_get.png)

In any case, you'll be able to add the default XYZ layer configured by default by QGIS.

## Algorithm toolbox

The processing toolbox can be open using the ![](images/icons/toolbox.svg#icon). The only difference with the regular `open toolbox` action is that the list of actions will be prefiltered to show only TravelTime platform relative algorithms.

![](images/reference/toolbox.png)

Similarly to all other QGIS algorithms, all those algorithms can be run normally by double-clicking them or in batch mode by right-clicking them.

### Simple

Algorithms regrouped under the `Simple` group provide simplified access to the advanced algorithms, but just call the advanced algorithms in the background. They cover most use cases and it is recommended to start with those before using the `Advanced` ones.

![](images/icons/timefilter_simple.svg#icon) Run the [simplified time filter algorithm](#-time-map-simplified)

![](images/icons/timemap_simple.svg#icon) Run the [simplified time map algorithm](#-time-filter-simplified)

![](images/icons/route_simple.svg#icon) Run the [simplified route algorithm](#-route-simplified)

### Advanced

Algorithms regrouped under the `Advanced` group provide access to the API endpoints. Since they have a lot of options, they are only recommended for advanced users that require to fine tune parameters that are not configurable in the simplified versions.

![](images/icons/timefilter_advanced.svg#icon) Run the [advanced time filter algorithm](#-time-map-advanced)

![](images/icons/timemap_advanced.svg#icon) Run the [advanced time map algorithm](#-time-filter-advanced)

![](images/icons/route_advanced.svg#icon) Run the [advanced route algorithm](#-route-advanced)

### Utils

Algorithms regrouped under the `Utilities` group provide access to the Geocoding (assigning a point to a textual address) or Reverse geocoding (assigning a textual address to a point). algorithms.

![](images/icons/geocoding.svg#icon) Run the [geocoding algorithm](#-geocoding)

![](images/icons/geocoding_reversed.svg#icon) Run the [reverse geocoding algorithm](#-reverse-geocoding)

## Algorithms

### ![](images/icons/timemap_simple.svg#icon) Time map (Simplified)

This algorithm provides a simpified access to the time-map endpoint.

![](images/reference/example_timemap.png)

It can be used to get information such as a service area polygon based on travel time of different means of transport.

#### Parameters description

![](images/reference/timemap_simple.png)

**Searches:** Choose a point layer from which represents input coordinates.

**Search type:** Whether the coordinates represent the departure or the arrival points.

**Transportation type:** Which transportation types to consider.

**Departure/Arrival time:** The departure or arrival time. Searches are time dependent, as depending on the date/time, public transport or traffic condition may be different.

**Time zone:** Define the time zone of the departure/arrival time.

**Travel time (in minutes):** The total duration from arrival to destination.

**Result aggregation:**

- NORMAL will return a polygon for each departure/arrival search
- UNION will return the union of all polygons for all departure/arrivals searches.
- INTERSECTION will return the intersection of all departure/arrival searches.

**Output layer:** Where to save the output layer. If you leave this empty, the result will be loaded as a temporary layer. It is still possible to save a temporary layer afterwards by right-clicking it in the legend and choosing "make permanent".

**Robust mode (advanced parameters):**

By default, if any error happens, even on just one search, the algorithm fails and returns no result. In cases where partial results are still desired, you can enable robust mode. This will prevent batching and ignore failing requests, returning partial results. Note that this will consume your API quotas much faster.

### ![](images/icons/timefilter_simple.svg#icon) Time filter (Simplified)

This algorithm provides a simpified access to the time-filter endpoint.

![](images/reference/example_timefilter.png)

It can be used to get filter a point layer using a time search.

#### Parameters description

![](images/reference/timefilter_simple.png)

**Searches:** Choose a point layer from which represents input coordinates.

**Search type:** Whether the coordinates represent the departure or the arrival points.

**Transportation type:** Which transportation types to consider.

**Departure/Arrival time:** The departure or arrival time. Searches are time dependent, as depending on the date/time, public transport or traffic condition may be different.

**Time zone:** Define the time zone of the departure/arrival time.

**Travel time (in minutes):** The total duration from arrival to destination.

**Locations:** The points layer to search from.

**Load fares information:** Load informations about fares in the resulting attributes.

**Output layer:** Where to save the output layer. If you leave this empty, the result will be loaded as a temporary layer. It is still possible to save a temporary layer afterwards by right-clicking it in the legend and choosing "make permanent".

**Robust mode (advanced parameters):**

By default, if any error happens, even on just one search, the algorithm fails and returns no result. In cases where partial results are still desired, you can enable robust mode. This will prevent batching and ignore failing requests, returning partial results. Note that this will consume your API quotas much faster.

### ![](images/icons/route_simple.svg#icon) Route (Simplified)

This algorithm provides a simpified access to the route endpoint.

![](images/reference/example_route.png)

It can be used to get the best routes between two sets of points.

#### Parameters description

![](images/reference/routes_simple.png)

**Searches:** Choose a point layer from which represents input coordinates.

**Search type:** Whether the coordinates represent the departure or the arrival points.

**Transportation type:** Which transportation types to consider.

**Departure/Arrival time:** The departure or arrival time. Searches are time dependent, as depending on the date/time, public transport or traffic condition may be different.

**Time zone:** Define the time zone of the departure/arrival time.

**Locations:** The points layer to search from.

**Load fares information:** Load informations about fares in the resulting attributes.

**Output style:**

- BY_ROUTE : return one linestring per route
- BY_DURATION : return one linestring per route, broken down by travel time
- BY_TYPE : return one linestring per route segment (allows to map mulimodal routes)

**Output layer:** Where to save the output layer. If you leave this empty, the result will be loaded as a temporary layer. It is still possible to save a temporary layer afterwards by right-clicking it in the legend and choosing "make permanent".

**Robust mode (advanced parameters):**

By default, if any error happens, even on just one search, the algorithm fails and returns no result. In cases where partial results are still desired, you can enable robust mode. This will prevent batching and ignore failing requests, returning partial results. Note that this will consume your API quotas much faster.

### ![](images/icons/timemap_advanced.svg#icon) Time map (Advanced)

This algorithm provides advanced access to the time-map endpoint.

As it has a lot of options, it is recommended for beginners to rather use the simplified version of this algorithm.

It can be used to get information such as a service area polygon based on travel time of different means of transport.

#### Parameters description

The parameters match closely the API. They are best documented on [the API documentation](http://docs.traveltimeplatform.com/reference/time-map/).

All parameters are expressions, which allow you to freely use the QGIS expression engine to define each of those parameters, which includes access to all features attributes.

The `[fields to keep]` parameter allows to specify fields from the inputs to keep in the output.

#### Differences with the API

**Spatial operations**

In the API, it is possible to specify which intersections or unions to compute. This doesn't work well with typical GIS tabular inputs, so that this algorithm only allows to compute the INTERSECTION or UNION on all inputs.

Consider using this algorithm in conjunction with other QGIS algorithms if you need advanced INTERSECTION or UNION features.

Besides, while the API supports INTERSECTION and UNION of searches, the plugin performs these operations locally in order to work when batching queries. This means there may be minor differences in results geometries.

**Fixing geometries**

It happens that the API returns invalid geometries. While usually making no visible difference, invalid geometries can cause issues when further processing the features. The algorithm by default fixes all geometries in a post-processing step. In most cases, this option should be left enabled.

**Robust mode**

By default, if any error happens, even on just one search, the algorithm fails and returns no result. In cases where partial results are still desired, you can enable robust mode. This will prevent batching and ignore failing requests, returning partial results. Note that this will consume your API quotas much faster.

### ![](images/icons/timefilter_advanced.svg#icon) Time filter (Advanced)

The parameters match closely the API. They are best documented on [the API documentation](http://docs.traveltimeplatform.com/reference/time-filter/).

All parameters are expressions, which allow you to freely use the QGIS expression engine to define each of those parameters, which includes access to all features attributes.

#### Differences with the API

**Searches and locations**

In the API, all coordinates are to be provided in the `locations` parameter, and then searches specify locations ids. As this doesn't suit well GIS workflows, the algorithm separates source for searches and for location.

**Robust mode**

By default, if any error happens, even on just one search, the algorithm fails and returns no result. In cases where partial results are still desired, you can enable robust mode. This will prevent batching and ignore failing requests, returning partial results. Note that this will consume your API quotas much faster.

### ![](images/icons/route_advanced.svg#icon) Route (Advanced)

The parameters match closely the API. They are best documented on [the API documentation](http://docs.traveltimeplatform.com/reference/routes/).

All parameters are expressions, which allow you to freely use the QGIS expression engine to define each of those parameters, which includes access to all features attributes.

#### Differences with the API

**Searches and locations**

In the API, all coordinates are to be provided in the `locations` parameter, and then searches specify locations ids. As this doesn't suit well GIS workflows, the algorithm separates source for searches and for location.

**Robust mode**

By default, if any error happens, even on just one search, the algorithm fails and returns no result. In cases where partial results are still desired, you can enable robust mode. This will prevent batching and ignore failing requests, returning partial results. Note that this will consume your API quotas much faster.

### ![](images/icons/geocoding.svg#icon) Geocoding

This algorithm provides a simpified access to the geocoding endpoint.

It can be used to assign geographical coordinates to textual data such as addresses.

#### Parameters description

![](images/reference/geocoding.png)

**Input data:** The input layer. This layer should have attributes representing an address or a location name.

**Restrict to country:** Only return the results that are within the specified country

**Results type:**

- ALL will return several results per input, corresponding to all potential matches returned by the API.
- BEST_MATCH will only return the best point.

**Search expression:** The field containing the query to geocode. Can be an address, a postcode or a venue. For example SW1A 0AA or Victoria street, London. Providing a country or city the request will get you more accurate results

**Focus point:** This will prioritize results around this point. Note that this does not exclude results that are far away from the focus point

**Output layer:** Where to save the output layer. If you leave this empty, the result will be loaded as a temporary layer. It is still possible to save a temporary layer afterwards by right-clicking it in the legend and choosing "make permanent".

### ![](images/icons/geocoding_reversed.svg#icon) Reverse geocoding

This algorithm provides a simpified access to the reverse geocoding endpoint.

It can be used to assign a textual address to geographical coordinates.

#### Parameters description

![](images/reference/geocoding_reverse.png)

**Input data:** The input layer. This layer must have point geometries.

**Restrict to country:** Only return the results that are within the specified country.

**Results type:**

- ALL will return several results per input, corresponding to all potential matches returned by the API.
- BEST_MATCH will only return the best match.

**Output layer:** Where to save the output layer. If you leave this empty, the result will be loaded as a temporary layer. It is still possible to save a temporary layer afterwards by right-clicking it in the legend and choosing "make permanent".

## Issues

Unfortunately, it may happen that you encounter some issues. This section may help address some of the most common issues.

### Common issues

#### Running the algorithms from the toolbox fail

Have a close look at the first few lines in red of the output, and see if you some corresponding help here.

##### Could not connect to the API

This means that the plugin could not connect to the webservice. Make sure you are online and that your connection works properly. If the error persists, please [contact us](#contact-us) as it may be due to some issue with the web service.
